AR Portrait — Quick test project (A-Frame + AR.js)
===============================================

What this is
-------------
This is a small demo project that shows how to run an AR.js + A-Frame page locally to test "living portrait" overlays.
- It supports a **video overlay** (put a `video.mp4` file in the same folder), or
- Falls back to a visible 3D box / placeholder image so you can test immediately without extra assets.

Files included
--------------
- `index.html` — the AR demo page (load this in a browser).
- `README.md` — this file.

Step-by-step: run locally (Step 4)
----------------------------------
1. Put the project folder on your development computer:
   - you can unzip the package and open the folder `ar-portrait`.

2. (Optional) Add your `video.mp4` to the same folder if you want the video overlay to appear.

3. Start a simple local web server from inside the `ar-portrait` folder.

   **Python 3 (recommended, cross-platform)**
   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux / Windows (with Python3 installed)
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   or (Windows)
   ```bash
   py -3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

   This serves the folder at `http://localhost:8000/`.

4. Test on the same computer:
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your desktop browser and you will see the demo.

5. Test on your phone (same Wi‑Fi network):
   - Find your computer's local IP address:
     - **Windows:** open Command Prompt → `ipconfig` → look for `IPv4 Address` under the Wi‑Fi adapter.
     - **macOS / Linux:** open Terminal → `ifconfig` and find your IP (commonly `192.168.x.x`), or use `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on mac.
   - On your phone's browser (same Wi‑Fi), open:
     ```
     http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
     ```
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.45:8000`

6. Camera permission:
   - The page will ask to use the camera; allow it.
   - Point the phone camera at a marker to trigger AR content.

Markers: hiro vs custom portrait marker
--------------------------------------
- For a **quick test**, use the built-in **`hiro`** marker (no extra files required). Search the web for "hiro marker ar" and print that image (large, good contrast).
- For a **custom portrait marker** (use your actual portrait as the trackable):
  1. Generate a `.patt` file using the AR.js marker generator:
     - Generator URL: `https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html`
  2. Download `marker.patt` and the marker image (print the marker image and put it near the portrait).
  3. Place `marker.patt` in this project folder (same level as `index.html`).

HTTPS and iOS note
------------------
- Many mobile browsers require **HTTPS** to allow camera access for pages served from a remote IP (exceptions: `localhost` is usually allowed).
- If you plan to access the page over the network from a phone (not `localhost`), and your phone/OS blocks the camera on `http://`:
  - Easiest workaround: **deploy to GitHub Pages** (free, provides HTTPS).
  - Alternative: use **ngrok** to create an HTTPS tunnel to your local server.

Quick GitHub Pages deploy (one-off)
----------------------------------
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g. `ar-portrait`).
2. Commit the files and push:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "AR.js portrait test"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/ar-portrait.git
git push -u origin main
```
3. In GitHub repo settings → Pages → set branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)` → Save.
4. After a minute you'll get an HTTPS URL like `https://yourname.github.io/ar-portrait/`. Use that link for QR codes.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Camera blocked: check browser address bar for camera permission and ensure you're using HTTPS (or `localhost`).
- Marker not recognized: print marker with good contrast and stable lighting; keep the camera steady.
- Video not autoplaying: many mobile browsers require user tap to play media; tap the page (the HUD) to allow the demo to start the video.

Next steps
----------
- Replace `video.mp4` with an animated portrait (e.g., generated by D-ID, Runway, HeyGen).
- Replace fallback plane with a GLTF 3D model for richer effects.
- If you want, I can generate a ZIP with this template (ready to download) — see attached.
